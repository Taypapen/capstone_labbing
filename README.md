# capstone_labbing
Contains early versions of scripts to be used in Capstone project. For testing/training before finalized repo. Contains files that will not be used for final version.

Organized into folders for fulfilling certain assignments/ logical groupings:

/Models:
- Contains Prototype Model Implementation on full dataset in Prototype.ipynb
- Contains Checkpoint with Prototype Model Weights in ckpt.pth.tar
- Contains Full models (Lipreading1 and Lipread2) in pytorch_nn.py
- Contains Pytorch "Building Blocks" for use with other scripts in pytorch_blocks.py
- Contains full ResNet/classic ResNet implementation in with_other_resnet.py

/Experiment_with_models:
- For assignment: Step 7: Experiment With Various Models (14.1 Assignment)
- Contains main assignment file various_model_testing.ipynb
- Contains Custom Training Class "FullTrainer" in Model_training_blocks.py
- Contains training loop designing/original model designing in model_labbing.ipynb
- Contains Hyperparameter intial value testing in main.ipynb

/Preprocessing_and_Dataset:
- First step to preprocessing is Extract_face_points.ipynb (on raw video files/dataset)
- Crop_mouth.ipynb uses generated facepoints and raw video files/dataset for cropped Arrays to be used in dataset
- datasetloading.py contains Dataset class and creates DataLoader for model training

/Sample_Data:
- Sample of Data generated by preprocessing for training model. Also shows dataset structure.
